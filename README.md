![struction]![S-CAGNS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a39e9b74-de7c-4adb-b572-34a2a29a6acb)

**S-CAGNS:**We propose a Confidence-Aware Generalizable Nuclei Segmentation strategy(S-CAGNS) aimed at enhancing the generalizability of nuclei segmentation by retaining high-confidence regions' accuracy while effectively handling low-confidence areas.

S-CAGNS_2d is the details of training and the weight file of training.See [here](https://zenodo.org/records/14091623) 

Data analysis results shows the analysis results of the segmentation data of all models, which contains more indicators, and the actual use only includes IoU, Dice, F1 score.

The Predict folder is a visualization of the segmentation effect.
