**S-CAGNS:**We propose a Confidence-Aware Generalizable Nuclei Segmentation strategy(S-CAGNS) aimed at enhancing the generalizability of nuclei segmentation by retaining high-confidence regions' accuracy while effectively handling low-confidence areas.

S-CAGNS_2d is the details of training and the weight file of training.See [here](https://zenodo.org/records/14091623) 

Data analysis results shows the analysis results of the segmentation data of all models, which contains more indicators, and the actual use only includes IoU, Dice, F1 score.See [here](https://zenodo.org/records/14091623) 

The Predict folder is a visualization of the segmentation effect.See [here](https://zenodo.org/records/14091623) 

The S-CAGNS _ Model is the model detail code.See [here](https://zenodo.org/records/14091623)
